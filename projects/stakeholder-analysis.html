                    The goal of the DON Dashboard is to display and monitor performance across the DON's strategic goals and initiatives. It aims to serve as an enterprise-wide source of performance data, in line with DON PIO’s vision to "be the DON's trusted source of integrated analytics to navigate strategic decisions and achieve improved outcomes."
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are reaching out to our key stakeholders to better understand the current utilization of analytics within your office and learn how we can further support your goals and initiatives with the dashboard. Your input is very important as it will help us create a dashboard that is relevant to users and fully representative of DON performance.
                </p>
